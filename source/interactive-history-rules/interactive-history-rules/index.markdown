The Interactive History concept was introduced in the Aria gameline. The idea was that instead of persons (or in addition to persons) the players would play whole societies. The way this differs from for example playing Civilization (or any other game of strategy) is that the culture is given the highlight. The rules given by Aria for IH provide a rough way to resolve military but, more importantly, also social and political conflicts. The results are highly interpretative: to really work they need to fleshed out by the players and the GM. This means some work, but when done, it gives a highly enjoyable gaming experience!

In short, the idea of interactive history is to let each player play the governement, or the ruling agency, of the society of their choice. Besides nations, the players may choose to lead another kind of societies: secret societies, or churches. Or he may play key persons in the game: master tradesmen, powerful barons, heroes or saints. The player has several options to do. He can

    * expand his country by war or diplomacy
    * increase his own power in his country
    * or, and this is the most fun, change the culture of his country: guide the path of a nation from barbaric kingdom to an advanced peace-loving democracy - or the other way around 

The dice system provided by Aria is a bit obscure, and for this and other reasons I decided to try to convert the IH mechanics to FUDGE.
